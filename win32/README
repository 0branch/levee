This is the configuration for levee on windows 10 (win32, but with
the mode flag ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING which turns on the
builtin ansi terminal emulator for commandline programs.  This might
work on any old version of windows, but all I know is that it's a
new feature in windows 10.)


Instead of running configure.sh, copy win32/config and
win32/Makefile.{compiler} into the main levee directory and then
you can run the make program to build levee.


As of 24-Mar-2019 the only windows C compiler that's been used
is PellesC.
